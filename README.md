# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps companies identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information, including:
- **Demographic details** (e.g., gender, age, location)
- **Account information** (e.g., tenure, contract type, payment method)
- **Usage patterns** (e.g., call duration, data usage)
- **Target variable:** `Churn` (1 if the customer left, 0 otherwise)

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Models Used
Three models were trained and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression** - Achieved **83% accuracy**
2. **Decision Tree** - Achieved **86% accuracy**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Achieved **75% accuracy**

## 📊 Performance Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**
